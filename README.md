# Just4Learning

Working to grok GitHub (this is in the <u>working branch</u> of my Just4Learning repo; and this edit was made locally). Can we do color?  <span style="color:red">some *blue* text</span>.  Apparently not.

## Playing with GH Page Themes

A link to [A Subordinate Page](NewPage.md)

## Editing in Ubunutu

And another change to confirm my GH login info is really in VS-Code.

A quick edit to test my copied repo.

## HTML Tables?

Seeing how an HTML table embedded in my Markdown renders on
GH

## Branching in VSCode

Created a new branch on the laptop in VSCode (easy).  Now need to figure out how to push it to GitHub.

Simple push didn't work: "no upstream configured for branch `BMTest`".  :-(

OK, turns out it worked after all!

## A Dummy Branch

Should appear in the new branch, only.

This sentence is only in the new test branch I just made until I merge it!

Because Dave only understands version control in concept, not in practice. And it seems like I ought to be able to do better. So now I've installed the desktop (built on Electron) and am trying things out locally.

This is just text. I guess a good step would be learning to incorporate pictures!  Right now I don't see how to do pictures. Looking at Duncan's glossary, it looks like they get embedded with HTML image tags. 

Making a local change in parallel with a remote change.

Well, it only took 6 tries, but I managed to get an image in here!

![All the Bad Luck](/images/All-the-bad-luck.jpg)
<figcaption>"Image of a man taking ALL the chances"</figcaption>

There was something about drag-n-drop, so let's try that:

Well, that didn't work, but it gives me a chance to add some changes to this file, too.

OK, I've added another image, let's link it in: 
(turns out it works better if you get the filename right)
![Gitting It Done](/images/Gitting-It-Done.png)

How about them apples.

Adding something to this branch on GH to try out fetch / merge on the local clone.

And something more!
